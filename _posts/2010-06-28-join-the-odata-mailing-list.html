<p>Today we released an OData Mailing List.  This is the list to use if you have OData questions, comments on OData or want to discuss how OData should evolve over time.</p>
<p>To sign up to the list go <a href="http://mailinglist.odata.org/SCRIPTS/WA-ODATA.EXE?SUBED1=ODATA&amp;A=1"> here</a> and follow the instructions provided.  The list is fully open so anyone can subscribe and participate.  Be sure to read the terms of use on the signup page to understand how your feedback on the mailing list may be used to enhance OData over time.</p>
<p>You can see a read only archive of all the messages from the mailing list here: <a title="/mailing-list" href="https://www.odata.org/join-the-odata-discussion/">/mailing-list</a></p>
<p>We look forward to hearing your thoughts, comments and feedback!</p>

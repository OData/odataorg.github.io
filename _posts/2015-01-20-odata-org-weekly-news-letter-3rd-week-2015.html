I’ve been working on a project to bring the major elements of SAP mobility together in a single example. This example will explore the details of creating a delta-enabled OData web service, something that I mentioned in my last blog post.<br />
At the end of the project we'll have this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A web service that supports OData Delta Token processingc
</li>
<li>A Hybrid Kapsel application created using Web IDE that uses that service</li>
<li>Support for disconnected operation in the mobile app using the SMP SDK’s Offline capabilities</li>
<li>Support for adding and editing records in the mobile app</li>
<li>Run both the web service and mobile application atop the HANA Cloud Platform</li>
</ul>

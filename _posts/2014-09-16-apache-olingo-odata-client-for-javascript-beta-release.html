<p>The Apache Olingo OData Client for JavaScript (ODataJS) is a library written in JavaScript that enables browser based front end applications to easily use the OData protocol for communication with application servers.</p>
<p>It is currently available in  version 4.0.0-beta-01 and supports the OData protocol in version 4.</p>
<p>The ODataJS library is the successor of the <a title="https://datajs.codeplex.com/" href="https://datajs.codeplex.com/">datajs</a> library and can be used in combination with datajs to allow communication with new OData V4 services and older OData services from the same web page.</p>
<p>Like the OData Java Client and Server Library the ODataJS library is also developed and maintained within the project <a title="https://olingo.apache.org/" href="https://olingo.apache.org/">Apache Olingo™</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to visit the <a title="https://olingo.apache.org/doc/javascript/index.html" href="https://olingo.apache.org/doc/javascript/index.html">ODataJS procject page</a> for further information about usage, download and contribution.</p>

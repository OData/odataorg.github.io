<p>It's been a little over a week since the new OData.org went live, and in that time we've had plenty of interesting feedback.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Here are some of the suggestions we've received:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Source the .NET Server libraries too (we announced and will release the .NET client libraries under apache soon). For more information read Miguel's <a href="http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Mar-22.html">post</a> where he makes his case.</li>
<li>Better guidance on how to integrate various Authentication schemes with OData. <a href="http://www.alexhudson.com/2010/03/24/on-odata/">Alex Hudson's post</a> argues strongly for more help in this area. We hear this particular feedback loud and clear, and are working to create some guidance.</li>
<li>Figure out how to use OData to supplement or replace the MetaWeblog API most blog engines use - Sounds like an interesting way to extend the reach of OData.</li>
<li>Binary version of the protocol. Mainly for perf/compression reasons - let's face it XML isn't exactly terse. We have been thinking about this, and have started considering things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_XML">Binary XML</a>.</li>
<li>Create a VBA client library so you can easily process OData inside Office applications.</li>
<li>Make it easy to download an OData feed into Excel - not via PowerPivot - directly into Excel.</li>
<li>Create some guidance showing how to mock the .NET client library.</li>
<li>Add OData support to more Microsoft products like the Dynamics family of products.</li>
<li>Work out exactly how OData works with and complements other linked data standards like RDF, OWL and SPARQL.</li>
<li>Create an OData wiki. Actually this is something we are already working towards.</li>
<li>Adopt a more open licensing model. Perhaps using Creative Commons Public Domain?</li>
<li>Consider working with W3C, IETF or OWF to standardize all the OData specifications.</li>
<li>Add an about page to the site, so we can find out about the people and companies currently funding working on OData.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think about these suggestions?</p>
<p>Do you have any of your own?</p>
<p>And in other developments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chris Woody Woodruff, of <a href="http://deepfriedbytes.com/">Deep Fried Bytes</a> fame, has started an OData wiki on <a href="http://odataprimer.com/">odataprimer.com</a>.</li>
<li>Andrew Lang, a professor at <a href="http://drexel.edu/">Drexel University</a>, told us about their <a href="http://showme.physics.drexel.edu/onsc/Services/OData.svc/">real-time solubility data as OData</a>.</li>
<li>The Dallas team posted <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dallas/archive/2010/03/24/the-data-grail.aspx"> The Data Grail</a>, a very exciting post about using Tableau and Dallas together to visualize an OData feed.</li>
<li>Brian Swan put together a post on the <a href="http://abcphp.com/out/crud-operations-with-the-odata-sdk-for-php-%7C-brian-swan/"> abc's of OData via PHP</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we work to add an OData mailing list and get a wiki up and running we'll write more summary posts like this.</p>
<p>So keep the <a href="http://odata.org/feedback">feedback</a> coming, as you can see we are listening.</p>

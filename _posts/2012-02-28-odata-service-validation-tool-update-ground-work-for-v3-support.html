<li>Added version annotation to rules to differentiate rules by version</li>
<li>Modified the rule selection engine to support rule version.</li>
<li>Change rule engine API to support rule versions</li>
<li>Changed database schema to log request and response headers</li>
<li>Added a V3 checkbox for online and offline validation scenarios</li>
</ul>
<p>This update brings the total number of rules in the validation tool to <strong>152.</strong> You can see the list of the active rules <a href="https://services.odata.org/validation/roadmap.htm#rules">here</a> and the list of rules that are under development <a href="https://services.odata.org/Validation/RuleSet/Rules?$filter=Status%20eq%20%27Approved%27">here</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, with this update the validation tool is positioned to support rules for v3 services for OData V3 payload validation.</p>

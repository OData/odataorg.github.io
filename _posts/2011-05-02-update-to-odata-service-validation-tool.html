<p>We pointed out when we <a href="https://www.odata.org/blog/odata-service-validation-tool">announced</a> the <a href="http://validator.odata.org/">OData Service Validation Tool</a> at Mix the other week, we are actively working on it and would add more rules to the service on a regular cadence.</p>
<p>We just pushed an update to the service with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added 3 new metadata rules</li>
<li>Fix for https endpoint support</li>
<li>Fixes for correctly highlighting error/warning lines in payload</li>
<li>Several other bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the release of the tool, the feedback that we received has been great. Thank you all for trying it and providing feedback.</p>
<p>It's also great to hear that there is interest in the source of the tool and potentially being able to contribute new rules. We heard that feedback and are in the process of making the tool open source. We will update you when the process is completed and the source code is available.</p>
<p>As always, please let us know what you think through the OData <a href="https://www.odata.org/join-the-odata-discussion/">mailing list</a>.</p>

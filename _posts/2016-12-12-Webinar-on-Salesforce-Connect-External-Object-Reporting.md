**Salesforce External Object Reporting with OData**

Reporting against external objects has been highly anticipated based on numerous requests on the [Idea on the success community](https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000lAFWAA2). Back in Winter ‘16, Mark Kovacevich [blogged](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/engineering/2016/02/salesforce-connect-reporting.html) on a popular workaround to use external objects for reporting with custom visual force pages and apex controllers. But starting in Winter ’17, there is much rejoicing among report geeks as the Salesforce Connect product team delivers a seamless reporting experience with external data made possible by support for a standard OData REST interface.

Ralf Schundelmeier Director of Product Management, Salesforce and Sumit Sarkar Chief Data Evangelist, Progress DataDirect will host a webinar with live Q&A and a demo of this new capability for Salesforce developers.

For a developer preview, below are screenshots of the [high level steps from the Winter ’17 release notes](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/winter17/release-notes/rn_forcecom_external_data_reports.htm) on getting started with external object reporting. The external data in this example is accessed from an on-premises SQL Server data mart connected on-demand by the [Progress DataDirect OData Reporting service](https://www.progress.com/data-connectivity/odata-salesforce-lightning-connect) for Salesforce Connect. Other popular reporting OData feeds are available with on-premises reporting platforms such as SAP Business Objects and SQL Server Reporting Services.

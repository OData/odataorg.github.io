               live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/KEY02">we announced</a> that we are open sourcing, under the Apache license, the WCF Data Services client code, which of course illustrates our commitment to fostering a vibrant OData Community.</p>
<p>Right now we're getting the code ready, which should take about a week or two, so you can expect this to be part of the OData SDK, hosted on CodePlex, sometime in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>As soon as that happens we'll let you know!</p>

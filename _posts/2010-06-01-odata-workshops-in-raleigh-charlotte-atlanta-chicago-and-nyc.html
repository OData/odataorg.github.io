                 www.chriswoodruff.com/">Woody</a>) Woodruff has organized a series of <a href="https://www.chriswoodruff.com/index.php/2010/05/11/odata-blowout-in-june-8-odata-workshops-in-raleigh-charlotte-atlanta-chicago-and-nyc/"> OData workshops</a> to compliment the official <a href="https://odata.org/roadshow">OData Roadshow</a>.</p>
<p>This is highly recommended. So if for whatever reason you can't make it to one of the OData Roadshow events, or you just can't get enough <a href="https://odata.org/">OData</a>, see if you can get along to one of Chris' workshops.</p>
<p>The workshops start in Raleigh tomorrow and finish in NYC on June 28th.</p>

<p>In order to make OData.org a more collaborative site, we are excited to announce that you can now easily contribute to OData.org at the <a href="http://www.odata.org/contribution">Contribution page</a>. Currently there are two ways for you to contribute</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Contribute to the OData Ecosystem</span></strong></p>
<p>You can publish your OData consumers, OData providers, OData live services, OData libraries and OData vocalbularies by navigating to the <a href="http://www.odata.org/contribution">Contribution page</a> and filling in the request form. Your request will be reviewed before publish. We will notify you through email in the process.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px;">Post Blogs on OData.org</span></strong></p>
<p>To post blogs on OData.org, you first need to apply for a contributor account which can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them. When you finish a blog post, please go to <a href="http://www.odata.org/contribution">Contribution page</a> to notify us for publishing it. We won’t set hard restrictions on blog posts. As long as the content is about OData and is good for the OData ecosytem, we will be very willing to publish them for you as soon as possible.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><em>Call for action</em></span></p>

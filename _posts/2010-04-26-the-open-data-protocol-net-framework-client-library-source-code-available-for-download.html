<p>We are happy to announce that we have made the source code for the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 and Silverlight 3.0 Open Data Protocol (OData) client libraries available for download on the Codeplex website. This release represents the OData team's continued commitment to the OData protocol and the ecosystem that has been built around it. We have had requests for assistance in building new client libraries for the OData protocol and we are releasing the source for the .NET Framework and Silverlight client libraries to assist in that process. We encourage anyone who is interested in the OData ecosystem and building OData client libraries to download the code.</p>
<p>The source code has been made available under the Apache 2.0 license and is available for download by anyone with a Codeplex account. To download the libraries, visit the OData Codeplex site at <a href="http://odata.codeplex.com/">http://odata.codeplex.com</a>.</p>

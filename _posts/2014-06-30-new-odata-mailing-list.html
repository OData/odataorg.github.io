<p>In order to make OData.org a more collaborative site, we have maintained a Mailing List for people to ask or answer questions related to OData. And now we are moving to a new mailing list service <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/odata-discussion">OData Discussion Group</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li>For users already subscribed to our <a href="http://mailinglist.odata.org/">old Mailing List</a>, please note that we will stop the support for it soon. So please move to the new OData Mailing List as soon as possible. </li>
<li>For new users, please just join the new mailing list.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view more detailed instructions of <a href="/join-the-odata-discussion/">how to join the new mailing list for OData</a>. All kinds of issues and feedbacks for OData are welcomed in this mailing list. If any problems and concerns, please comments below to let us know.</p>

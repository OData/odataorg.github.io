<p>I am pleased and excited to announce that the OASIS OData Technical Committee has produced a Committee Draft for a set of extensions to OData for Data Aggregation.<!--?xml:namespace prefix = "o" ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /--></p>
<p>This extension adds basic grouping and aggregation functionality (e.g. sum, min, and max) to OData without changing any of the base principles.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-data-aggregation-ext/v4.0/csprd01/odata-data-aggregation-ext-v4.0-csprd01.docx">draft</a> is in public review through September 19<sup>th</sup>, 2013. There is also a PowerPoint <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/document.php?document_id=50359&amp;wg_abbrev=odata">walkthrough</a> that provides a good overview of the functionality/design.</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of interest expressed in this functionality in the past, so I am hopeful that we'll have a lot of good discussion and feedback provided to the TC through the OASIS Mailing List as described in the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/news/announcements/30-day-public-review-for-odata-extension-for-data-aggregation-v4-0">announcement</a> of the public review.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your feedback!</p>

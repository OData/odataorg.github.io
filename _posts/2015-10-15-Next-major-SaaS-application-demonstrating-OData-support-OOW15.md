I am very excited about co-presenting an “ecosystem-changing” session around OData at Oracle OpenWorld 2015 this year.  This development represents the next major SaaS vendor to support accessing external data as an OData consumer.  One of the early OData consumers in the SaaS space was Salesforce with the [introduction of Lightning Connect](https://www.odata.org/blog/salesforce-external-object-integration-using-lightning-connect-with-odata/), and I had the privilege of presenting a session at Dreamforce on, “Lightning Connect: Lessons Learned”.

Lightning Connect is the new external data strategy for the Salesforce platform powered by OData and you can find the [latest news here](https://www.odata.org/blog/Lightning-Connect-New-in-OData-DF15/).

One month later on a different stage at Moscone Center, I get to co-present with Roderick Peace in a session titled, “Get Ahead: Oracle Service Cloud Integration Strategy—Spectrum of Integrations”. Learn more about the spectrum of integration strategies to external data from Oracle Service Cloud, including OData read/w
rite support.

#Hot topic in data connectivity for SaaS applications

There is growing demand for real-time integration patterns that work instantly “out-of-box/cloud” without additional integration development effort.  Salesforce calls it “click-not-code” and Oracle Service Cloud calls it “citizen development”.  The common theme is OData, an OASIS standard REST API.  

In the other direction, there are a number of SaaS applications that produce OData such as [SuccessFactors (An SAP Company)](http://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/scn/go/portal/prtroot/docs/library/uuid/e0dc0e49-8e3a-3110-4f9e-a307b1ffd8ce?QuickLink=index&overridelayout=true&58879706682777) or [Microsoft Dynamics](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg334767.aspx).  I predict that all major SaaS applications are actively developing external data strategies as OData consumers following Salesforce and Oracle Service Cloud.

#What’s the buzz around SaaS connectivity at Oracle OpenWorld ‘15?

Our session at Oracle OpenWorld is being billed as one of the most exciting developments for the OData ecosystem.  The OData community will be watching the action closely as multiple SaaS applications effortlessly exchange data via the OData standard.
The demo will include OData consumer support from one or more of the following: 

* Oracle Sales Cloud (CRM)
* Oracle Marketing Cloud (Eloqua)
* Oracle Service Cloud (RightNow)
* Oracle Talent Management (Taleo)
* Oracle Configure, Price and Quote (BigMachines) 

Unfortunately, I cannot say until the session.  But what I can say is that this will be a game changer for SaaS data integration patterns and here’s a teaser with Oracle Service Cloud pulling data in real-time from Salesforce Sales Cloud via OData:

# Introduction

OData.org is the community website for OData lovers. We have re-factored the site on **2015-5-15** for better **user experience**, better **performance** and easier **contribution flow**. Our previous architecture is WordPress + Windows Azure and the new architecture is **Jekyll + GitHub + Windows Azure**. Jekyll and GitHub are open-source solutions which benefit a lot from community contribution and are popular in the industry (just like the way we want to build the OData community :smiley:).

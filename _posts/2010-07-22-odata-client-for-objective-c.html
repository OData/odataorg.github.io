<p>We are happy to announce that today we released the OData Client for Objective-C library. With the library it is now possible to write iOS applications that connect to OData Services. The library includes a command line tool to generate proxy classes for the Entities expose by the OData Service and static libraries for iOS 3.2 and 4.0. Source code for all the components is provided with the download.</p>
<p>The source code has been made available under the Apache 2.0 license and is available for download at <a href="http://odataobjc.codeplex.com/">http://odataobjc.codeplex.com</a></p>

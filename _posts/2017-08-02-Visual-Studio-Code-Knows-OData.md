**Visual Studio Code Knows OData** 

Through a new [Visual Studio Code Extension for OData](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stansw.vscode-odata), developers can now get rich language support for the OData query language.

Enabled features include syntax highlighting and query encoding/decoding.  Syntax aware formatting, metadata-driven code completion, and diagnostics are available in a beta state, and can be enabled through settings.

If you're an OData developer using Visual Studio Code, this is a must-have extension. Give it a quick try, send feedback, and tell your friends!

<p>We pushed a new update to the <a href="http://validator.odata.org/">OData Service Validation Tool</a>. As you know we are updating the service every 2 weeks. Below is what's new in this update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added 5 new JSON rules. Including the new rules pushed 2 weeks ago we now have a total of 16 JSON rules</li>
<li>Fixed test result classifications for MustNot and ShouldNot requirement levels</li>
<li>Added Rule Extension Framework for code rules.
<ul>
<li>We have been focusing on structural rules so far. We added an extension mechanism to the rule engine to be able to add code based (semantic) rules. There are no such rules in the system yet but we are working on bringing such rules in to the rule engine and the UI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the meantime, we are also actively working towards open sourcing the tool. We are sorry for the lack of updates on this front but we are committed to making the tool open source and we are waiting for the legal process to be completed. We investigated our options and are currently working with the legal department to create the most appropriate contribution model so that it's also possible for the community to contribute rules.</p>
<p>There is no ETA for the release at the moment but we are in final stages of obtaining legal approvals. We will immediately announce when the source code is available.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued feedback and interest. We are all ears on the <a href="https://www.odata.org/join-the-odata-discussion/">OData Mailing List</a>. Please let us know if you have any feedback, questions and/or suggestions.</p>

The Apache Olingo OData Client for JavaScript (ODataJS) is a library whose focus is to enable browser based front end applications to easily use the OData protocol for communication with application servers. However, its also possible to use the library on java script servers and a sample is provided for this.

It is currently available in version 4.0.0 and supports the OData protocol in version 4.

The ODataJS library is the successor of the datajs library and can be used in combination with datajs to allow communication with new OData V4 services and older OData services from the same web page.

Like the OData Java Client and Server Library the ODataJS library is also developed and maintained within the project Apache Olingoâ„¢.

Feel free to visit the [ODataJS procject](https://olingo.apache.org/doc/javascript/index.html) page for further information about usage, download and contribution.

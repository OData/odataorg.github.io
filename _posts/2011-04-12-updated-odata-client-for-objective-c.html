<p>I am pleased to announce the second bug fix release of the OData Client for Objective-C library. This V1.2 release contains fixes for 36 bugs reported on codeplex.com since the last September release. This also adds support for basic authentication with <a href="https://datamarket.azure.com/">Windows Azure MarketPlace DataMarket</a>, formerly code named "Dallas", along with a new sample to demonstrate this feature. Notable fixes includes better handling of nil datatypes, namespace prefixes, and improved error and memory management.</p>
<p>Source code for all the components is provided with the download. The source code has continues to be made available under the Apache 2.0 license and is available for download at <a href="http://odataobjc.codeplex.com/">http://odataobjc.codeplex.com</a></p>
<p>I encourage you to continue developing using OData on all platforms, reporting your feedback, and sharing what iOS apps you are building.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

**OData 4.0 Published as ISO/IEC 20802** 

For those that missed the announcement, I'm thrilled to report that OData 4.0 has been ratified and published as an ISO/IEC Standard.

OData 4.0 was published as an OASIS Standard in February of 2014. OASIS submitted OData 4.0 (including Errata) to the ISO/IEC JTC 1 Information Technology body the following year, where it went through the standard review process before being unanimously approved in early 2016. The ISO/IEC publication became available early this year. 

The OData 4.0 Core Protocol is available as ISO/IEC 20802-1:2016, and the OData 4.0 JSON Format is available as ISO/IEC 20802-2:2016.

ISO ratification confirms a higher level of interoperability, and is important to many government agencies worldwide for open data solutions.

I'd like to take a moment to thank and congratulate the many individuals who have contributed over the years to establishing OData as an International Standard.

<p>OASIS <a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/odata/201206/msg00000.html">announced</a> today the Call for Participation for the new OASIS OData Technical Committee tasked with the responsibility of producing the OData Standard.</p>
<div>
<p>In addition to the core OData version 3.0 protocol found <a href="https://www.odata.org/documentation">here</a>, the Technical Committee will be defining some key extensions in the first version of the OASIS Standard:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/46084/ODataExtensionforDataAggregationv1.0.pdf"><b>OData Extensions for Data Aggregation</b> </a>- Business Intelligence provides the ability to get the right set of aggregated results from large data warehouses. OData Extensions for Analytics enable OData to support Business Intelligence by allowing services to model data analytic "cubes" (dimensions, hierarchies, measures) and consumers to query aggregated data.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/46086/ODataExtensionforTemporalDatav1.0.pdf"><b>OData Extensions for Temporal Data</b></a> – Temporal databases support querying data as of a particular time or time range. OData Extensions for Temporal data define temporal annotations, functions and semantics for describing and working with temporal data.</p>
<p><b>Working with </b><a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/46087/ODataExtensionforXMLDatav1.0.pdf"><b>XML</b></a><b> and </b><a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/46085/ODataExtensionforJSONDatav1.0.pdf"><b>JSON Data</b></a><b> in OData</b> – Databases often store XML or JSON documents as streams. Extensions for XML and JSON Data define custom functions and annotations to enable those documents to be represented and queried using functions appropriate to each domain (for example, custom XQuery functions for XML).</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astoriateam/archive/2011/04/13/reference-data-caching-walkthrough.aspx"><b>Retrieving Changes (Deltas) in OData</b></a><b> </b>– Data often changes relatively little over a period of time. In such cases, for example when maintaining a local copy, clients are interested only in retrieving what data has changed, not in re-retrieving the entire set of results. Deltas provide a hypermedia-driven mechanism for clients to request changes (inserts, deletes, updates) to a set of results.</p>
<p>In each of these areas the TC will be balancing the simplicity of OData with the need to do a little more, leveraging built-in OData extensibility mechanisms where possible.</p>
<p>Come join the OASIS Technical Committee and bring your scenarios, requirements, and ideas to help shape these exciting extensions to OData.</p>

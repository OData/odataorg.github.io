<p>In April, there will be several conference sessions about OData delivered by <a href="http://apr2014.desertcodecamp.com/user/20233">Chris Woodruff</a> at the <a href="http://apr2014.desertcodecamp.com/home">Desert Code Camp 2014.1</a>. The topics of the sessions are "<a href="http://apr2014.desertcodecamp.com/session/922">Why Windows 8 Applications need OData and How You can be a Data Ninja</a>" and "<a href="http://apr2014.desertcodecamp.com/session/924">Gaining the Knowledge of the Open Data Protocol (OData)</a>".</p>
<p><a href="http://apr2014.desertcodecamp.com/user/20233">Chris Woodruff</a> is a Microsoft MVP in Visual C# and a community leader who has rich experience and solid knowledge of the OData protocol and libraries over various platforms.</p>
<p>If you have conference sessions or talks about OData that you want to share with the OData community, please comment on this blog post with the information and links of the events. We will help publish the info onto OData.org.</p>
<p>In the near future, we are also considering building better ways for people to share and view events about OData on OData.org such as a submission system and a calendar view.</p>
<p>Thanks for your attention and looking forward to your contribution!</p>

Skyvia Connect is a cloud OData REST API service that allows to expose data of relational databases ([SQL Server](https://skyvia.com/connect/sql-server-odata), [MySQL](https://skyvia.com/connect/mysql-odata), [PostgreSQL](https://skyvia.com/connect/postgresql-odata), etc) and cloud apps ([Salesforce](https://skyvia.com/connect/salesforce-odata), [Dynamics CRM](https://skyvia.com/connect/dynamics-crm-odata), [NetSuite](https://skyvia.com/connect/netsuite-odata), etc). As a connectivity as a service solution, it does not require third-party drivers or any deployment efforts, so you can easily configure OData endpoints visually. Built-in security layer allows to manage endpoint access by defining user names with passwords or IPs/IP ranges, and monitor access to endpoints in details.

SAP Gateway, an integral part of SAP NetWeaver, lets you connect devices, environments, and platforms to SAP systems. It uses the Open Data Protocol (OData) so you can use any programming language or model to connect to SAP and non-SAP applications. SAP S/4HANA uses SAP Gateway and OData services to bring business data to compelling SAP Fiori apps.

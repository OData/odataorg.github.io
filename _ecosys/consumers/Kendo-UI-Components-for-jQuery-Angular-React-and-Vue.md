All data-bound UI components in the various Kendo UI libraries for jQuery, Angular, React, and Vue support binding to OData web services. This support is done through helper packages and methods which simplifies binding to OData within each of the libraries. This lets developers quickly bind to components like the Kendo UI Data Grid, Charts, Scheduler, TreeList, PivotGrid, and more - all through OData.

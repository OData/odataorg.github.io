Create documents using templates and data from OData-based platforms such as Exact Online or Microsoft Graph directly from Microsoft Word. You can use templates with pre-defined data definition to retrieve data, but you can also use Invantive SQL to join and filter data across OData-based and other sources such as SOAP, XML and traditional databases. For OData-providers not supported by Microsoft PowerBI a bridge is integrated into Word.

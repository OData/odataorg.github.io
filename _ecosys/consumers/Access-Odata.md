Access OData retrieves data sets directly from OData4 producers into the browser as CSV or Excel sheets, including additional support for Invantive Bridge Online to retrieve data from Twinfield, AFAS Online, ActiveCampaign, Salesforce, Teamleader, Exact Online, Loket, NMBRS and many other sources. Access OData uses no web server and runs independently in a modern browser on PC, Mac or phone.

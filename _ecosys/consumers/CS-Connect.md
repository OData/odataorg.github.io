The CS Connect interface product integrates Microsoft with ERP systems (e.g. SAP) and automates bidirectional data exchange. In this way, data that is relevant for decision-making purposes is always up to date and available to all participating users in the familiar Microsoft or SAP work environment. Consistent and current data can now be used to make accurate business decisions.

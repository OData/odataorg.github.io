Based upon ANSI-SQL with extension you can use Invantive SQL to retrieve and update information contained in OData-based platforms. The SQL grammar is described on https://cloud.invantive.com/sql-grammar/invantive-sql-grammar-current.html. This free SQL product does not support the use of joins and queries and updates distributed across multiple data containers in the cloud. An online version is available for several platforms on https://cloud.invantive.com/, supported on iPhone, iPad, Mac and Windows.

Download, relate and upload data stored in OData-based platforms directly from Microsoft Excel. You can use formules to retrieve and post data, but also use Invantive SQL to join and filter data across OData-based and other sources such as SOAP, XML and traditional databases. For OData-providers not supported by Microsoft PowerBI a bridge is integrated into Excel.

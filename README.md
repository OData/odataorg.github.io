# Appendix A: Markdown Syntax

We highly recommend using Markdown to create a blog post. 

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

### Markdown Basics
Markdown is very easy to use, with syntax below, you can write a pretty blog post.
#### Headings
You can create a heading by adding one or more `#` symbols before your heading text. 
```
# h1
## h2
…
###### h6
```
#### Blockquotes
You can indicate blockquotes with a `>`.
```
In the words of Abraham Lincoln:
> Pardon my french
```
#### Styling text
```
*This text will be italic*
**This text will be bold**
```
#### Lists
You can make an **unordered** list by preceding list items with either `*` or `-`
```
* Item
* Item

- Item
- Item
```
You can make an **ordered** list by preceding list items with a number.
```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
```
#### Code formatting
Use single backtick (`) to format text in a special monospace format. 

You can use triple backticks to format text as its own distinct block.


#### Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then wrapping the link in parentheses ( ( ) ).

# Appendix B: Code Formatting

There are two ways to formatting your code in a blog post.

**Markdown coding formatting**
You can use coding format supported in Markdown, use triple backticks to format text as its own distinct block. This is very easy to use, but not support syntax highlighting 

**Jekyll supported code formatting**
Since our site is built with Jekyll, you can also use Jekyll supported code formatting, which supports **syntax highlight**. To render a code block with syntax highlighting, surround your code as follows:
```
{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}
```
The argument to the `highlight` tag (`ruby` in the example above) is the language identifier. `ruby` here is a short name, for regually used short names:
- `csharp` for C#
- `javascript` for JavaScript
- `ruby` for Ruby
- `cpp` for C++
- `c` for C
- `java` for Java
- `json` for JSON
- `php` for PHP
- `python` for Python

If the language you used not listed above, please look for the “short name” on the [Pygments’ Lexers page](http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/).

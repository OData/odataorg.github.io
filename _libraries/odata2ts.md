[Flexible generator](https://odata2ts.github.io/docs/generator/configuration) to produce TypeScript types 
for the request and response models of your OData service or a full-fledged, domain-savvy OData client 
with configurable HTTP client (e.g. Axios). The OData client features 
a [type-safe and fluent query builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@odata2ts/odata-query-builder),
type-safe CRUD, bound or unbound operations and much more.

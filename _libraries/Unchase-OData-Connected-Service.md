Unchase OData Connected Service is a tool that generates code to facilitate consumption of OData services. This tool will generate a DataServiceContext and classes for each of the entity types and complex types found in the service description. It is functionally equivalent to the Add Service Reference for OData V1-V4 services. 
Also the Connected service contains a T4 item template which is used to generate C# and VB .NET client-side proxy classes for [OData protocol version 4.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/cs02/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-cs02-part1-protocol.doc) services. The generated classes work with the rebranded [OData Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.OData.Client) library for .NET. 
Connected service is available via visual studio marketplace at [Unchase OData connected service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Unchase.unchaseodataconnectedservice).

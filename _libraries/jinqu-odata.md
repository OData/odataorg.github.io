jinqu-odata lets you write lazily evaluated LINQ queries against an OData source. It's written in TypeScript and based on [jinqu](https://github.com/jin-qu/jinqu): The Ultimate JavaScript LINQ API.
You can use functions and lambdas, [JS parser](https://github.com/umutozel/jokenizer) will convert them into OData parameters.

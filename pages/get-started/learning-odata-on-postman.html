<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There are various ways to learn about OData and starting with the native HTTP request may be the most direct one. We have a series of <a href="/getting-started/basic-tutorial">Basic Tutorials</a> and <a href="/getting-started/advanced-tutorial">Advanced Tutorials</a> already, but these still ask you to copy&amp;paste the requests. We now provide an easier way to help you understand OData and contribute your own scenarios. We create a collection of OData HTTP requests using <a href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> - an efficient way to test, develop, and document APIs.</p>
<h2>How to Learn OData on Postman</h2>
<p>It's quite easy for Chrome users to install the Postman tool and run the collections. Just follow the steps below :</p>
<ul>
<li>Install <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">Postman</a></li>
<li>Import the collection
<ul>
<li>Click the "Import" button on the top bar.</li>
<li>Choose download from link and paste the <a href="https://www.postman.com/collections/bf7d9130241aaa7160d8">Postman collection URL</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>    You can find more details of Postman collection in <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/">Postman collection docs.</a> After you successfully import the collection, you can see the query collection as below :
</li>
</ul>
<p>And the resources behind this is on <a href="https://github.com/ODataOrg/Tutorials">OData tutorial Guidelines</a>.</p>
<div class="row">
    <div class="column">
        <img src="/assets/postmanCollection.jpg" width="800" height="490" onclick="openModal();currentSlide(1)"
        onenter id="postmanCollection-small" class="hover-shadow cursor" tabindex="0" alt="Postman collection">
    </div>
</div>
  
<div id="screenshot1" class="image-modal" >
    <div class="modal-content" >
        <div class="screenshot1Lightbox" width="800" height="490">
            <img src="/assets/postmanCollection.jpg" width="800" height="490" class="postcollection">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<p>As you can see from the picture above, we have created several requests into different categories in the collection with description, HTTP method, request URL, request headers and response payload (if no response, just click the <em>Send</em> button).</p>
<h2>How to Contribute to the Query Collection</h2>
<p>Currently, Postman collection doesn't support collaborating on one specific collection URL, so you may not directly contribute to the collection. BUT, you can contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/ODataOrg/Tutorials">GitHub repositories</a> which servers as a central OData tutorials guidelines and we will update the content regularly.</p>

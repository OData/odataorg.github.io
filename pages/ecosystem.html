<h2>Producers</h2>
OData producers are services that expose their data using the OData protocol. Below we have collected a list of key OData producers, which will continue to grow along with the OData ecosystem. You can use <a href="http://www.odata.org/libraries">OData SDK</a> to build your own OData producers. If you create or know of an OData producer not listed be sure to let us know via our new <a href="http://www.odata.org/contribution">contribution page</a>.

<a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/orm.aspx">Telerik OpenAccess ORM</a>In mid-2010 Telerik released a LINQ implementation that is simple to use and produces domain models very fast. Built on top of the enterprise-grade Telerik OpenAccess ORM the LINQ implementation allows you to easily build an OData feed via a few easy steps by using the OpenAccess Visual Designer and the Data Services Wizard.

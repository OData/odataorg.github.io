<h1 id="opendataprotocolodatabatchprocessing"></h1>
<h1 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>The OData protocol defines a way to query and manipulate data (described using an EDM model) using a simple set of operations. This document builds on the ‘Interaction Semantics’ section of the core OData specification document and describes how an OData implementation MAY support executing multiple operations sent in a single HTTP request through the use of Batching. This document covers both how Batch operations are represented and processed.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, the contents of this document is defined as part of OData version 1.</p>
<h1 id="sendingabatchrequest">2. Sending a Batch Request</h1>
<p>Batch requests allow grouping multiple operations, as described in [<a href="../odata-version-3-0-core-protocol">OData:Core</a>], into a single HTTP request payload. A batch request MUST be represented as a Multipart MIME v1.0 message [<a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2046.txt">RFC2046</a>], a standard format allowing the representation of multiple parts, each of which may have a different content type (as described in [<a href="../atom">OData:Atom</a>], [<a href="https://www.odata.org/media/30002/json">OData:JSON</a>] and [<a href="../json-verbose-format/">OData:JSONVerbose</a>]), within a single request.</p>
<h2 id="batchrequestheaders">2.1 Batch Request Headers</h2>
<p>Batch requests MUST be submitted as a single HTTP POST request to the batch endpoint of a service, which MUST be located at the URI &lt;Service Root URI&gt;/$batch. Service Root URIs are defined in [<a href="../odata-version-3-0-core-protocol">OData:Core</a>].</p>
<p>The batch request MUST contain a Content-Type header specifying a content type of “multipart/mixed” and a boundary specification as defined in [<a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2046.txt">RFC2046</a>]. &lt;Batch Request Body&gt; is defined in the Batch Request Body section below.</p>
<pre><code>POST /service/$batch HTTP/1.1
Host: odata.org
DataServiceVersion: 1.0 
MaxDataServiceVersion: 3.0 
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=batch_36522ad7-fc75-4b56-8c71-56071383e77b

&lt;Batch Request Body&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>As shown in the example above and, as described in the Versioning section of [<a href="../odata-version-3-0-core-protocol">OData: Core</a>], batch requests SHOULD contain applicable DataServiceVersion headers.</p>
<p>Finally, batch requests MUST NOT include an X-HTTP-Method header (i.e. use POST tunelling) as batch requests are by definition POST only.</p>
<h2 id="batchrequestbody">2.2 Batch Request Body</h2>
<p>The body of a batch request MUST be made up of an ordered series of query operations and/or ChangeSets. A query operation in the context of a batch request is either a query or Function invocation request as described in [<a href="../odata-version-3-0-core-protocol">OData:Core</a>]. A ChangeSet is an atomic unit of work consisting of an unordered group of one or more of the insert/update/delete operations, Action invocations or Service Operation invocations described in [<a href="../odata-version-3-0-core-protocol">OData:Core</a>]. ChangeSets MUST NOT contain query operations and MUST NOT be nested (i.e. a ChangeSet cannot contain a ChangeSet).</p>
<p>In a batch request body, each query operation and ChangeSet MUST be represented as a distinct MIME part (i.e. is separated by the boundary defined in the Content-Type header). A MIME part representing a query operation MUST include a Content-Type header with value “application/http” and a Content-Transfer-Encoding“ header with value ”binary". The contents of a MIME part representing a ChangeSet MUST itself be a multipart MIME document (see [<a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2046.txt">RFC2046</a>]) with one part for each operation that makes up the ChangeSet. Each part represnting an operation in the ChangeSet MUST include the same headers (Content-Type and Content-Transfer-Encoding) and associated values as previously described for query operations.</p>
<p>Preambles and Epilogues in the MIME payload, as defined in [<a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2046.txt">RFC2046</a>], are valid but MUST are assigned no meaning and thus MUST be ignored by processors of batch requests.</p>
<p>Each MIME part body which represents a single request SHOULD NOT:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include authentication or authorization related HTTP headers because it is unlikely the infrastructure used for authentication will parse and utilize such headers.</li>
<li>Include Expect, From, Max-Forwards, Range, or TE headers because their contents will be ignored.</li>
</ul>
<p>Processors of batch requests MAY choose to disallow additional HTTP constructs in HTTP requests serialized within MIME part bodies. For example, a processor MAY choose to disallow chunked encoding to be used by such HTTP requests.</p>
<p>The example below shows a sample batch request that contains the following operations in the order listed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Query request</li>
<li>A Change Set that contains the following requests:
<ul>
<li>Insert entity</li>
<li>Update request</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second query request</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: For brevity, in the example, request bodies are excluded in favor of English descriptions inside ‘&lt;&gt;’ brackets and DataServiceVersion headers are omitted.</p>
<h3 id="referencingrequestsinachangeset">2.2.1 Referencing Requests in a Change Set</h3>
<p>If a MIME part representing an Insert request within a ChangeSet includes a Content-ID header, then the new entity represented by that part may be referenced by subsequent requests within the same ChangeSet by referring to the Content-ID value prefixed with a “$” character. When used in this way, $&lt;contentIdValue&gt; acts as an alias for the URI that identifies the new entity.</p>
<p>The example below shows a sample batch request that contains the following operations in the order listed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A ChangeSet that contains the following requests:
<ul>
<li>Insert a new entity (with Content-ID = 1)</li>
<li>Insert a second new entity (references request with Content-ID = 1)</li>

<h1 id="respondingtoabatchrequest">3. Responding to a Batch Request</h1>
<p>Requests within a batch MUST be evaluated according to the same semantics used when the request appears outside the context of a batch.</p>
<p>The order of ChangeSets and query operations in a Batch request is significant as a service MUST process the components of the Batch in the order recieved. The order of requests within a ChangeSet is not significant as a service MAY process the requests within a ChangeSet in any order.</p>
<p>All operations in a ChangeSet represent a single change unit so a service MUST successfully process and apply all the requests in the ChangeSet or else apply none of them. It is up to the service implementation to define rollback semantics to undo any requests within a ChangeSet that may have been applied before another request in that same ChangeSet failed and thereby honor this all-or-nothing requirement.</p>
<p>If the set of request headers of a Batch request are valid (the Content-Type is set to multipart/mixed, etc) the service MUST return a 202 Accepted HTTP response code to indicate that the request was accepted for processing, but the processing yet to be completed. The requests within the body of the batch may subsequently fail or be malformed; however, this enables batch implementatios to stream the results.</p>
<p>If the service receives a Batch request with an invalid set of headers it MUST return a 4xx response code and perform no further processing of the request.</p>
<p>A response to a batch request MUST contain a Content-Type header with value ‘multipart/mixed’.</p>
<p>Structurally, a batch response body MUST match one-to-one with the corresponding batch request body, such that the same multipart MIME message structure defined for requests is used for responses. The exception to this rule is that when a request within a Change Set fails, the Change Set response is not represented using the multipart/mixed media type. Instead, a single response, using the “application/http” media type and a Content-Transfer-Encoding header with a value of “binary”, is returned that applies to all requests in the Change Set and MUST be formatted according to the Error Handling section of [<a href="../odata-version-3-0-core-protocol">OData:Core</a>].</p>
<p>Finally, a response to a query operation in a batch MUST be formatted exactly as it would have appeared outside of a batch as described in Querying Data section of [<a href="../odata-version-3-0-core-protocol">OData:Core</a>].</p>
<p>For example, referencing the batch request in section 2.2, assume all the requests except the final query request succeed. In this case the response would be as shown in the following example.</p>
